# AND101 Project 6 - CYOAPI Part 2: RecyclerView Edition

Submitted by: **Cameron Smith**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## Summary

**PokePeek Recycler** is an Android app that **displays a scrollable list of Pok√©mon from the Pok√©API, showing each Pok√©mon‚Äôs sprite, name, and ID, with live data fetched via AsyncHTTPClient.**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **üß©üì°üêæ**

## Application Features

<!-- (This is a comment) Please be sure to change the [ ] to [x] for any features you completed.  If a feature is not checked [x], you might miss the points for that item! -->

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [x] Implement a RecyclerView to display a list of entries from the API
- [x] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each RecyclerView item

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [x] Add a UI element for the user to interact with API further (tap item ‚Üí toast with name/ID)
- [x] Show a `Toast` when an item is clicked
- [x] Add item dividers with `DividerItemDecoration`

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [x] Capitalize Pok√©mon names and zero-pad IDs (e.g., `#001`)
- [x] Efficient image loading with Glide
- [x] Extract ID from API URL to avoid extra network calls

## Notes

- Used **Pok√©API** endpoint: `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=151`
- Parsed `results[].name` and extracted ID from `results[].url`, then built sprite URL:

- Main learnings: wiring a RecyclerView to live API data, basic list item optimization, and handling JSON safely.
